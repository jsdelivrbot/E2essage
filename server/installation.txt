To check the status of the server on heroku go to https://e2essage.herokuapp.com/
If you see the JSON {"status": "running"} then it means the server is on.
The server is hosted in the cloud, but can also be run locally, to do that, run these commands in the terminal or command line:
npm install (with sudo if necessary)
npm mongo
npm start (in a second terminal/command line)
